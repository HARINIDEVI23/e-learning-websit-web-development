                Computer Networking is the practice of connecting computers together to enable communication and data exchange between them.
                 In general, Computer Network is a collection of two or more computers. 
                 It helps users to communicate more easily. 
                 In this article, we are going to discuss the basics which everyone must know before going deep into Computer Networking.<br><br>
               <h>  <u>How Does a Computer Network Work?</u></h><br><br>
                 Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links. 
                 A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more. 
                 Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks.<br><br>

                 The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate. 
                 Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device.<br><br>
                
              <h>  <u> Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks</u></h><br><br>
                 Network: <br>A network is a collection of computers and devices that are connected together to enable communication and data exchange.<br><br>
Nodes:<br> Nodes are devices that are connected to a network. These can include computers, Servers, Printers, Routers, Switches, and other devices.<br><br>
Protocol:<br> A protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over a network. Examples of protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.<br><br>
Topology:<br> Network topology refers to the physical and logical arrangement of nodes on a network. The common network topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree.<br><br>
Service Provider Networks:<br> These types of Networks give permission to take Network Capacity and Functionality on lease from the Provider. Service Provider Networks include Wireless Communications, Data Carriers, etc.<br><br>
IP Address:<br> An IP address is a unique numerical identifier that is assigned to every device on a network. IP addresses are used to identify devices and enable communication between them.<br><br>
DNS:<br> The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that is used to translate human-readable domain names (such as www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.<br><br>
Firewall:<br> A firewall is a security device that is used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls are used to protect networks from unauthorized access and other security threats.
