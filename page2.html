            <h2>Bus Topology</h2>
            <p>Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. The cable functions as a backbone for the network.</p>
            <p>Advantages of Bus Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to set up and extend.</li>
                <li>Requires less cable length compared to other topologies.</li>
                <li>Cost-effective for small networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages of Bus Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single point of failure: If the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.</li>
                <li>Performance decreases as more devices are added.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="topology-section" id="star">
            <h2>Star Topology</h2>
            <p>In a star topology, each computer and network device is connected to a central hub or switch. Data on a star network passes through the hub or switch before continuing to its destination.</p>
            <p>Advantages of Star Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralized management and easy troubleshooting.</li>
                <li>Failure of one device does not affect the rest of the network.</li>
                <li>High performance even with many devices connected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages of Star Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dependent on the central hub or switch; failure of the hub can bring down the entire network.</li>
                <li>Requires more cable compared to bus topology.</li>
                <li>Costlier to implement and maintain.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="topology-section" id="ring">
            <h2>Ring Topology</h2>
            <p>Ring topology is a network configuration where each network device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular pathway for data to travel. Data travels in one direction only, from one device to the next and back again, until it reaches its destination.</p>
            <p>Advantages of Ring Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equal access to the network for all devices.</li>
                <li>No collisions in data transmission.</li>
                <li>Simple to install and configure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages of Ring Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failure of one device can disrupt the entire network.</li>
                <li>Difficult to troubleshoot and expand.</li>
                <li>Slower performance compared to star and mesh topologies.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="topology-section" id="mesh">
            <h2>Mesh Topology</h2>
            <p>Mesh topology is a network design in which each network node connects directly to every other node. Mesh networks are typically used in wide area networking where reliability and scalability are important.</p>
            <p>Advantages of Mesh Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly reliable: Multiple paths for data transmission ensure network redundancy.</li>
                <li>Scalable: Easy to expand by adding more nodes.</li>
                <li>High performance: Can handle heavy traffic loads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disadvantages of Mesh Topology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Costly to implement and maintain due to the large number of connections.</li>
                <li>Complex to design and configure.</li>
                <li>Requires more cable compared to other topologies.</li>
