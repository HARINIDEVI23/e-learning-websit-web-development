<h1>IPv4 Addressing</h1>
<div class="container">
  <div>
    <h2>Classful Addressing</h2>
    <p>In classful addressing, IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class A: Supports large networks with few network segments. IP addresses start with a number from 1 to 126 in the first octet.</li>
      <li>Class B: Suitable for medium-sized networks. IP addresses start with a number from 128 to 191 in the first octet.</li>
      <li>Class C: Ideal for small networks. IP addresses start with a number from 192 to 223 in the first octet.</li>
      <li>Class D: Reserved for multicast addresses. IP addresses start with a number from 224 to 239 in the first octet.</li>
      <li>Class E: Reserved for experimental purposes. IP addresses start with a number from 240 to 255 in the first octet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classless Addressing</h2>
    <p>In classless addressing, IP addresses are not restricted to specific classes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses.</li>
        <li>Utilizes Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).</li>
        <li>Divides the IP address space into smaller subnets, resulting in efficient utilization of address space.</li>
        <li>Reduces the size of routing tables and simplifies routing.</li>
        <li>Helps overcome the limitations of classful addressing and IPv4 address exhaustion.</li>
        <li>Enables efficient utilization of the IP address space by allowing for custom-sized subnets.</li>
        <li>Facilitates easier allocation of IP addresses to networks of various sizes.</li>
        <li>Reduces address wastage by allowing for finer control over subnet sizes.</li>
        <li>Enables more efficient routing by reducing the size of routing tables and improving the scalability of the internet.</li>
        <li>Supports hierarchical network design, allowing for better organization and management of network resources.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows for more efficient use of IP addresses by assigning smaller subnets to areas with fewer hosts and larger subnets to areas with more hosts.</li>
            <li>Reduces IP address wastage by tailoring the subnet mask to the specific number of hosts required in each subnet.</li>
            <li>Enables the design of a hierarchical network structure that optimizes the use of available IP addresses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminates the concept of address classes (Class A, B, and C) and allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses.</li>
            <li>CIDR notation represents an IP address followed by a slash and a number, indicating the number of bits used for the network portion of the address (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).</li>
            <li>Allows for the aggregation of IP addresses into a single routing table entry, reducing the size of routing tables and the overhead associated with routing protocols.</li>
            <li>Plays a crucial role in delaying the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses by efficiently utilizing the available address space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of Classless Addressing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Facilitates more efficient use of IP addresses by allowing for variable-length subnet masks.</li>
            <li>Reduces the size of routing tables and improves the scalability of the internet.</li>
